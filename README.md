# Mystery-Rooms
Innerve Mystery Rooms event

It was renamed then as "The Wizards Unite" to sound more fun and exciting.  <br>
**Description:** We organised the prestigious Triwizard tournament which was a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of wizardry. The participants had to answer a few quirky questions to get glimpse of how well they knew about Harry Potter!!

Before the main tournament( which involved coding questions) there was preliminary round followed by the 3 main stages: All the 4 levels including the preliminary one had a Harry Potter related question followed by a coding question. They had to choose a Harry Potter question answering which correctly (under 1 minute) would earn them a hint for their coding question.
